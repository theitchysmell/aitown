# AI Town Application

## Project Overview
AI Town is a web-based application that simulates an interactive environment for AI agents. Each agent has a unique profile with details such as name, age, preferences, skills, occupation, routines, and social connections. The application allows for the creation, management, and interaction of these agents, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Features
- Agent Creation: Users can create and customize their AI agents.
- Agent Interaction: AI agents can interact based on their defined characteristics and relationships.
- Builder Interface: A tool for users to collaboratively construct and manage AI agent attributes and interactions.
- Community Hub: Users can engage with a community of other AI enthusiasts, share insights, and collaborate on projects.
